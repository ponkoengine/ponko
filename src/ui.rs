//! [`Ui`]: the screen's UI, as `ctx.ui`.
//!
//! **What lives here.** The retained widget tree with its screen stack,
//! focus and queued events ([`Ui`]); who has the pointer and the keyboard
//! ([`Ui::wants_pointer`], [`Ui::wants_keyboard`]); and the immediate
//! widgets for debug overlays, `ctx.ui.immediate` ([`UiImmediate`]), with
//! their [`UiStyle`]. A [`d3::UiPanel`](crate::d3::UiPanel) carries a tree of its own for a
//! surface in the 3D world.
//!
//! **When to call it.** Build the tree in setup, then change its text,
//! values and screens from any system. The engine lays it out and feeds it
//! input before the frame's systems, so events queued this frame are read
//! with [`Ui::events`] in a frame or simulation system, and it is drawn
//! above the scene after them. Immediate widgets are drawn the frame they
//! are called: call them every frame from a frame system.
//!
//! **What it needs.** Nothing to build and query: the tree lays itself out
//! and takes input without a window, so tests drive it headless. Drawing
//! needs a window. The immediate widgets are drawn through
//! [`ctx.immediate_ui()`](crate::ctx::Ctx::immediate_ui), which lends them the
//! graphics and input services, so `ctx.ui` holds none of them and borrows
//! apart from the world and the other services: read its events while
//! playing sounds or changing entities.
//!
//! ```
//! use ponko::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn menu(ctx: &mut Ctx) {
//!     let click = *ctx.world.resource::<Sound>();
//!     // `ctx.ui` and `ctx.audio` are separate fields.
//!     for event in ctx.ui.events() {
//!         if let ponko::ui::UiEvent::Clicked(_) = event {
//!             ctx.audio.play(click);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! Game::new("ui", 320, 240).sim_system(menu).run_headless(1, |ctx| {
//!     let click = ctx.audio.create(8000, &[0.0; 80]);
//!     ctx.world.insert_resource(click);
//!     let start = ctx.ui.add(ponko::ui::UiWidget::Button, ponko::ui::UiLayout::auto());
//!     ctx.ui.push_screen(start, false);
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Layout is delegated to [Taffy](https://docs.rs/taffy/0.15.1/taffy/), which
//! provides flexbox/grid without owning rendering or an event loop. The
//! engine's sprites and text render the widgets.
//! [Egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) is easy to embed but
//! immediate-mode; it remains the inspector rather than the game UI.
//! [Xilem/Masonry](https://docs.rs/xilem/latest/xilem/) is retained but its
//! standard integration brings Vello rendering and winit window handling.
//! An owned tree plus Taffy keeps game textures, styling and input ownership
//! in one place while using a proven layout implementation.
//!
//! UI is drawn in window pixels on top of everything, built from sprites, so
//! it batches with everything else.
