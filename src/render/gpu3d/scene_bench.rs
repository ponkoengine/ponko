//! Offscreen 3D scenes for the rendering performance baseline (`ponko_bench`,
//! `render/scene`): eight reproducible worlds drawn with the real
//! `Renderer3D` into a texture, without a window, each frame split into the
//! steps a game's frame has (collect, prepare, encode, submit, the GPU's
//! work) and counted (draw calls, triangles, uploads, GPU memory).
//!
//! The scenes are made of engine content only: boxes, spheres, planes, a
//! height field, generated textures and a generated skinned figure, placed
//! by a fixed pseudo-random sequence, so every run draws the same thing.
//!
//! This is the `Renderer3D` a game uses, driven the way `Ctx::prepare_3d`
//! and `Renderer::render` drive it, but it is not a whole game frame: there
//! are no systems, no 2D or UI layer, no presentation and no display wait.
//! Nothing here changes what a game's frame runs; the harness only calls
//! the renderer and reads counters it already keeps. Not part of the public
//! API. See `crates/ponko_bench/RENDER_SCENES.md`.
