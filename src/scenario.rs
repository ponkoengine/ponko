//! Tick-indexed input scenarios: scripted raw input and assertions, run
//! through the real input and action path, for reproducible gameplay tests
//! and for tools that drive a running game.
//!
//! A scenario is a list of steps keyed by simulation tick. Input steps feed
//! an [`InputEvent`] before that tick's simulation systems run; check steps
//! look at the game after they ran. A run reports its outcome in a
//! [`ScenarioReport`] kept in the world, with the failing step and tick when
//! a check fails. Scenarios also read from and write to a small versioned
//! JSON format (see [`InputScenario::from_json`]).
