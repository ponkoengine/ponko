//! GPU asset loading by name: residency budgets, asynchronous streaming
//! with a per-frame upload budget, deterministic asset states, and textures
//! that stream in from a small stand-in up to full resolution.
//!
//! [`Graphics`](crate::gfx::Graphics) (`ctx.gfx`) is the one service that
//! owns GPU assets. Which loader to use:
//!
//! | Call | Waits for the file | Under a residency budget |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`load_texture`](crate::gfx::Graphics::load_texture), `load_mesh` | yes | no: kept until freed |
//! | [`resident_texture`](crate::gfx::Graphics::resident_texture), `resident_mesh` | the first time | yes |
//! | [`stream_texture`](crate::gfx::Graphics::stream_texture), `stream_mesh` | never | yes |
//!
//! Two budgets, both on `Graphics`:
//! [`set_upload_budget`](crate::gfx::Graphics::set_upload_budget) limits
//! the bytes uploaded per frame, and
//! [`set_residency_budget`](crate::gfx::Graphics::set_residency_budget) the
//! bytes of each [`ResidencyKind`] kept on the GPU. The calls that can evict
//! take the [`World`] too, because eviction never takes what an entity shows.
//!
//! The module also holds the tools for a game's own content, which hold no
//! assets: [`Job`] runs background work (loading and building a tile,
//! decoding a file) on a worker thread, and `CellStreamer` (with the `3d`
//! feature) says which cells of a grid to load or drop as the camera moves.
//!
//! [`Graphics::stream_texture`](crate::gfx::Graphics::stream_texture) (and, with the `3d` feature,
//! [`Graphics::stream_mesh`](crate::gfx::Graphics::stream_mesh)) never wait: the first call starts decoding the file
//! on a [`Job`] thread and returns `None`; once decoded, the
//! asset is uploaded at the start of a frame, within the
//! [upload budget](crate::gfx::Graphics::set_upload_budget). A texture appears first as a
//! stand-in at most 32 pixels a side and doubles in resolution each upload
//! until it is full size or its [residency budget](crate::gfx::Graphics::set_residency_budget)
//! is reached. Evicted textures drop back to that stand-in; evicted meshes
//! keep their id for when they come back.
//!
//! Each asset's [`AssetState`] changes only in that upload step, and
//! uploads run in the order the assets were asked for. With
//! [`Graphics::set_deterministic_uploads`](crate::gfx::Graphics::set_deterministic_uploads) the step waits for decoding instead of
//! moving on, so which frame each state changes in depends only on the
//! order of requests and the budget: the same run gives the same frames.
//! States are fixed per frame, not per simulation tick (a frame may run
//! several ticks or none). Without it, decodes finish when the workers do:
//! the frame an asset arrives in, and so the order new textures get their
//! ids in, can differ between runs.
