//! Scenes and prefabs: worlds and entities kept in files under `assets/`.

//! A scene is a whole world (the [`WorldReflect::save`] format): a level, a
//! menu, a test setup. A prefab is an entity or a tree of them, spawned as
//! many times as you like: a tree, an enemy, a cart with its wheels. Both are JSON, so they
//! diff well, and agents and the editor write them like any other file.

    /// | State | After `load_scene` |
    /// |---|---|
    /// | Entities | Replaced by the scene's, with the scene's ids. An old [`Entity`] handle may now name a different entity of the new scene. |
    /// | Reflected resources | Those in the scene are written; reflected ones it doesn't name stay. |
    /// | Other resources | Kept as they were (scores you didn't reflect, tuning loaded with [`load_resource`](crate::assets::Assets::load_resource), a baked navigation mesh). |
    /// | Components that aren't reflected | Gone with their entities; [`save_scene`](crate::assets::Assets::save_scene) reports them under `"not_saved"`. |
    /// | [`commands`](Self::commands) | Commands queued earlier in the running system are dropped: they were meant for the old entities. Commands queued after the load apply as usual. |
    /// | [`events`](Self::events) | Kept: events sent before the load can still be read for their usual lifetime. Entity ids inside them (such as [`CollisionStarted`](crate::collision::CollisionStarted)) refer to the old world. |
    /// | 2D and 3D physics | Bodies, characters and joints are removed at once (queries find nothing), then built from the new components at the next physics step, from rest unless the scene has a velocity component. Gravity, collision meshes, contact hooks and settings are kept. |
    /// | [`spatial`](Self::spatial) neighbor grid | Refilled at the start of the next simulation tick. |
    /// | 3D navigation (`NavMesh3D`, with the `navmesh` feature) | The baked mesh, a resource, is kept. Crowd agents are components, so they go with their entities; `step_navmesh3d` frees the old agents' crowd slots at its next step, and agents added to the new scene's entities (even with the same ids) start from where they are. |
    /// | [`Attached`](crate::attach::Attached), `Attached3D` (with the `3d` feature) | Reflected: the scene's attachments, to the scene's entities. [`follow_attachments`](crate::systems::follow_attachments) places them at its next run and despawns those whose entity isn't in the scene. |
    /// | Skeletons and morph weights | Components that aren't saved: gone with their entities unless the game adds them again. The engine's skinning scratch is rebuilt every frame from the world as it is. |
    /// | [`SkinOf`](crate::anim::SkinOf), [`AttachToJoint`](crate::anim::AttachToJoint), 3D joints | Reflected: the scene's, to the scene's entities. Skeletons aren't saved, so skins and joint attachments show once the game gives their entity a skeleton again. |
    /// | [`PrefabParts`] | Reflected: the scene's prefab trees keep their parts, for [`despawn_prefab`](Self::despawn_prefab). |
    /// | Assets | Textures, meshes and collision files the scene names are loaded first and stay cached. Loaded assets are never unloaded by a load. |
    /// | Prefabs | Kept: files [`spawn_prefab`](Self::spawn_prefab) read stay cached, so spawning one after a load doesn't read it again. |
    /// | Positional sounds | A sound playing from an entity stops at the next audio update unless that entity still has the same playing source; other sounds and music keep playing. |
    /// | Retained UI, camera, lighting, input, time, random seed | Kept: they belong to the game, not the scene. |
    /// | 3D UI panels (`UiPanel3D`, with the `3d` feature) | Components: gone with their entities. Which panel had the keyboard is forgotten, so a new panel with the old one's id doesn't get it without a click. |
    /// | Temporal history (TAA, temporal AO, reflections) | Reset, as by `reset_temporal_history` (`3d` feature): the new scene's models have no motion from the old one's. |
    /// | Lockstep networking ([`net`](Self::net)) | Not synchronized: a load changes only this peer. In a session, load from a simulation system (every peer runs it at the same tick) or in setup (every peer runs it before the first tick); [`load_scene_lockstep`](Self::load_scene_lockstep) is the same call, named for that.
