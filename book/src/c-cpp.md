# C and C++

Games can be written in C++ (or plain C) as well as Rust. They use the same
engine: the same ECS, game loop, renderer, spatial grid and control endpoint
for agents. Wherever a feature exists in the C API, the chapters of this guide
show the C++ version of its examples next to the Rust one; where it doesn't,
the chapter says so.

- `include/ponko.hpp`: the C++17 wrapper, header-only. `ponko::game`,
  `ponko::ctx` and `ponko::world_view` mirror Rust's `Game`, `Ctx` and
  `World`.
- `include/ponko.h`: the C API underneath, generated from the `ponko_ffi`
  crate with cbindgen.
- One shared library, `ponko_ffi` (`libponko_ffi.dylib`/`.so`,
  `ponko_ffi.dll`).

Loops over entities run in your C++ code, over **whole component arrays**,
so a million entities never mean a million calls across the language
boundary, and `each_par` runs them on all cores.

## Get the library

**From a release.** Each GitHub release, starting with 0.1.0, has an archive
per platform: `ponko-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`,
`ponko-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz` and `ponko-v0.1.0-windows-x86_64.zip`.
Each holds

- `include/`: `ponko.h` and `ponko.hpp`, matching the library next to them;
- `lib/`: `ponko_ffi` as a shared library (`libponko_ffi.so`,
  `libponko_ffi.dylib`, or `ponko_ffi.dll` with its import library
  `ponko_ffi.dll.lib`) and a static library;
- the licenses, `NOTICE`, and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` with the license of
  every library linked into `ponko_ffi`. Ship that file with your game.

Point CMake at it with `-DPONKO_INCLUDE_DIR=<archive>/include
-DPONKO_LIBRARY_DIR=<archive>/lib`, or use any build system: add the include
directory and link the library.

**From source.** `cargo build -p ponko_ffi --release` builds the same library
into `target/release/`; the headers are in `include/`. Build both from the same
commit. The release libraries have `ponko_ffi`'s default features; turn other
optional parts on with `ponko_ffi`'s features (for example
`--features accessibility`, or `--features compressed-textures` for
`.ktx2` files through `ponko_ctx_load_texture`, see
[Compressed textures](drawing.md#compressed-textures)).

## Build and run the examples

From the repository root, with Rust, CMake, a C11 compiler and a C++17 compiler:

```sh
cargo build -p ponko_ffi --release
cmake -S examples/cpp -B target/native -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPONKO_LIBRARY_DIR="$PWD/target/release"
cmake --build target/native --config Release
ctest --test-dir target/native -C Release --output-on-failure
./target/native/ponko_cpp_boids                                  # window
HEADLESS=1 BOIDS=1000000 TICKS=300 ./target/native/ponko_cpp_boids
./target/native/ponko_cpp_battle                                 # the battle demo
HEADLESS=1 UNITS=1000000 TICKS=600 ./target/native/ponko_cpp_battle
```

In PowerShell, replace `$PWD` with the repository's absolute path, using
forward slashes; Visual Studio builds use `--config Release` and put programs
in `target/native/Release/`.

For your own game, copy the recipe in `examples/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`: include
the two headers, link `ponko_ffi`, ship its shared library next to your
executable, and put your textures in an `assets/` folder next to it (the
example copies the repository's `assets/`). Rebuild against the matching
header when you update the engine.

### The ABI version

`ponko_abi_version()` returns `2`, and `ponko.h` defines `PONKO_ABI_VERSION` as
`2`: the first is the loaded library, the second the header your program was
compiled against. They differ when a program is built against one release's
headers and runs with another's `ponko_ffi`. `ponko.hpp` compares them the first
time a `ponko::game` or `ponko::world` is made and throws a `ponko::error`
(kind `PONKO_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED`) that names both numbers. In C, or when you load
the library yourself, make the same check at startup:

```c
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.c:abi_check}}
```

Within a version, existing functions and struct layouts never change and new
releases only add functions and enum values. The version stays 2 for 0.1.0: the
old C spellings were removed before any native artifact was released,
and every `ponko_*` function, layout and numeric value is unchanged.

## A C++ game

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:first_game_full}}
```

- Systems are anything callable as `void(ponko::ctx&)`. Lambdas can capture
  your game state by reference: the game runs inside `run()`, so it outlives
  nothing it captures.
- `run(setup)` opens the window; `run_headless(ticks, setup)` runs the
  simulation alone and returns the world (see [Headless runs](headless.md)).
  Startup code can also go on the builder with `setup(fn)`, followed by
  `run()` or `run_headless(ticks)` (see
  [Setup on the builder](getting-started.md#setup-on-the-builder)); in C,
  `ponko_game_setup`.
- Errors become exceptions. An exception thrown by your system stops the game
  and comes out of `run()`; it never crosses into the engine.

## Components

C++ components are plain structs: standard-layout, trivially copyable and
trivially destructible. No `std::string`, `std::vector` or owning pointers in
components; store ids or indices and keep other objects outside the ECS.

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.cpp:cpp_components}}
```

There's nothing to register: calls find a component by its C++ type, and
the engine learns about the type the first time it sees one. It's named
after the type, namespaces included (`game::Health`), which is how tools and
saves show it; `world.reflect<T>("Name", fields)` picks another name.

The built-ins are C++ types too: `ponko::transform2d` is `Transform2D`
(the same bytes as Rust), `ponko::attached` is `Attached`,
`ponko::animation` is `Animation`, `ponko::velocity` is `Velocity`, and
`ponko::sprite` is `Sprite` (spawn, get and set, but not a query parameter,
since the engine stores sprites in a Rust layout; the compiler tells you).
[Physics](physics.md) bodies and colliders, `ponko::rigid_body` and
`ponko::collider`, work like sprites.

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.cpp:cpp_world}}
```

## Queries and threads

`world.each(fn)` calls your function for every entity with the components
it takes (see [Queries](ecs.md#queries)); `world.query<A, B>(fn)` hands you
whole arrays instead. While a loop runs, the world and context are busy:
other world or context calls throw (C: return `PONKO_BUSY`), except

- commands: `despawn_later`, `spawn_later`, `set_later`, `remove_later`,
  applied when the system returns (in `each` and `query`, not in the `_par`
  versions);
- events: `send` and `read` (also not in the `_par` versions; see
  [Events](events.md));
- spatial queries, and the clock values `dt()`, `sim_tick()`, `random()`.

`each_par` and `query_par` split archetypes into slices and run your function
on all cores at once. It must only touch its own entity and read shared
data; that is the same rule as Rust's `par_for_each`.

To visit only the entities whose component changed, name a filter:
`world.each<ponko::changed<Health>>(fn)`. A parameter taken as `T&` counts
as a change, `const T&` doesn't; see
[Change detection](ecs.md#change-detection).

To visit only the entities that have or lack components, name `with`,
`without`, `or_` and `all_of` the same way, the C++ spelling of Rust's
`With`, `Without`, `Or` and tuples of filters:
`world.each<ponko::with<Player>, ponko::without<Dead>>(fn)`. C builds the
same filters from component ids (`ponko_filter_*`, `ponko_query_filtered`); see
[Queries](ecs.md#queries).

`each` is as fast as a hand-written loop over the arrays: 1M entities,
`position += velocity`, take 0.15 ms either way
(`examples/cpp/bench.cpp`).

Everything else stays on the thread that runs the game.

## Speed

The battle demo is a whole game, written twice: `examples/battle.rs` and
`examples/cpp/battle.cpp`. Both have flow fields, per-team grids, combat on
all cores, reinforcements and rounds. Same seed, same map, same armies
(the C++ `rng` gives the same numbers as Rust's), release builds,
`HEADLESS=1 UNITS=… TICKS=1200`:

| Units | Rust | C++ |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 20k | 0.57 ms/tick | 0.57 ms/tick |
| 200k | 4.04 ms/tick | 4.24 ms/tick |
| 1M | 18.85 ms/tick | 19.97 ms/tick |

The hot loops use views (`grid.view()`, `flow.view()`) that the header reads
inline, so nothing crosses into the engine per unit. The gap for big armies
is in rebuilding the per-team grids: Rust feeds them straight from the
units, C++ copies each team's units into an array first.

`HEADLESS=1 BOIDS=… ./ponko_cpp_boids` and `HEADLESS=1 BOIDS=… cargo run
--release --example boids` run the same flocking, release builds, on the
development Mac (arm64, 2026-11-03):

| Boids | Rust | C++ |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 100k | 3.5 ms/tick | 3.9 ms/tick |
| 1M | 31.3 ms/tick | 34.5 ms/tick |

The remaining gap is mostly the C++ version copying velocities into its own
array each tick before rebuilding its grid. Plain column updates (one million
`p += v`, `cargo run --release --example ffi_bench` vs `ponko_cpp_bench`,
which times `each` and `query`) run at the same speed in both: about 0.15 ms.

Grid queries in hot loops should use views (`ctx.spatial_view()`,
`grid.view()`): the header walks the grid inline, as Rust does. Through the
query functions, C++ boids took 41.5 ms/tick at 1M.

## Plain C

C uses the same functions without the wrapper: status codes instead of
exceptions, a `user` pointer instead of captures.

```c
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.c:c_world}}
```

```c
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.c:c_columns}}
```

A headless game in C:

```c
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.c:c_game}}
```

```c
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/main.c:c_run}}
```

Every call returns `PonkoStatus`; on failure `ponko_last_error()` has the
message and `ponko_last_error_kind()` its kind, a `PonkoErrorKind` that
mirrors Rust's `ponko::error::ErrorKind` (`PONKO_ERROR_NOT_FOUND`, `PONKO_ERROR_SHADER`,
..., per thread, until the next failed call). C++ throws `ponko::error`, a
`std::runtime_error` whose `kind()` is that kind. Null arguments, wrong
sizes, unknown ids, duplicate query columns and busy worlds are rejected.
Pointers you pass must still be valid: the library can't recognize a
dangling pointer or a buffer smaller than you say. Callbacks must return
normally; never let a C++ exception or `longjmp` cross them.

## Constructors and destructors

Two shapes exist, and one rule says which a new function uses.

- **New functions: a status and an out-pointer.** `enum PonkoStatus
  ponko_thing_new(args, struct PonkoThing **out)`. The status carries
  `ponko_last_error_kind()` for the failure, a null pointer can't be mistaken
  for success, and the call looks like every other. Follow this for anything
  added from now on. Today: `ponko_clip_new`, `ponko_snapshot_stream_new`,
  `ponko_interest_new`, `ponko_steam_lobby_create`, and the functions that make
  something inside a game or context and write back an id
  (`ponko_ctx_create_*`, `ponko_ctx_load_*` and `ponko_ctx_try_load_*`).
- **Older standalone objects: the pointer, null on failure.** `struct PonkoThing
  *ponko_thing_new(args)` returns null and sets `ponko_last_error()`.
  `ponko_world_new`, `ponko_game_new`, `ponko_access_new`, `ponko_action_map_new`,
  `ponko_nav_new`, `ponko_flow_new`, `ponko_grid_new`, `ponko_nav_sources_new`,
  `ponko_latest_wins_new`, `ponko_input_scenario_new`, `ponko_cells_new`,
  `ponko_memory_source_new`, `ponko_ui_access_new`, `ponko_heightfield_new`,
  `ponko_far_terrain_new`, `ponko_terrain_tile_data_new`,
  `ponko_animation_graph_builder_new` and the mesh-data and filter builders
  work this way. They keep their shape: changing
  it would break the ABI.

Destructors of owned objects are `void ponko_thing_free(struct PonkoThing *)`.
(`ponko_ctx_handle_free` is not one: it frees an engine handle by id inside a
context and returns a status like the other `ponko_ctx_*` calls.) The exception
is `ponko_world_free`, which returns a status: a world can be busy (a query is
running) or borrowed (it belongs to a game or a context), and then it is *not*
freed. `PONKO_BUSY` tells you the handle is still live and still yours, so you
don't treat it as freed. The C++ `ponko::world` destructor ignores the status
(it can't throw); its move assignment throws it.

## Errors and the `try_` loaders

Rust's `ponko::error::Error` has a kind, the asset path it is about (if any) and a
message. C has the same three for the last failure on the thread:
`ponko_last_error_kind()`, `ponko_last_error_path()` (empty when the failure
names no asset) and `ponko_last_error()`; `ponko_error_kind_name(kind)` gives
a short name for logs ("not found", "decode", ...). C++ throws
`ponko::error`, with `kind()`, `path()` and `what()`, and `ponko::kind_name`.

The `try_` loaders return the error instead of panicking (Rust) or throwing
(C++): `try_load_texture`, `try_load_font`, `try_load_sound`,
`try_load_stream` and `try_load_mesh`, plus `try_load_shader`,
`try_load_effect` and `try_load_compute` in C++. C++ returns a
`ponko::result<T>`: test it like a bool, `*` or `value()` for the value (which
throws the error if it failed), `value_or(fallback)`, `error()` and `kind()`.

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
fn gold_skin(ctx: &mut Ctx) -> Option<Texture> {
    match ctx.gfx.try_load_texture("skins/gold.png") {
        Ok(skin) => Some(skin),
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("{} ({:?}): {}", e.path().unwrap_or(""), e.kind(), e.message());
            None
        }
    }
}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:try_load}}
```

</div>
</div>

C: `ponko_ctx_try_load_texture`, `_font`, `_sound`, `_stream` and `_mesh`
return `PONKO_NOT_FOUND` for a missing file and `PONKO_INVALID_ARGUMENT` for
any other error, with the kind and path set, and leave the output untouched.
The older `ponko_ctx_load_texture` and friends keep their status codes; the
C++ `load_*` calls now use the `try_` functions, so the `ponko::error` they
throw has the real kind and path.

## C functions without a C++ wrapper

Every C function in `ponko.h` has a C++ wrapper in `ponko.hpp`, except these,
where C++ does the same thing another way:

| C function | In C++ |
|---|---|
| `ponko_ctx_load_texture`, `ponko_ctx_load_mesh`, `ponko_ctx_load_sound`, `ponko_ctx_load_stream`, `ponko_ctx_load_font` | `ctx::load_*` call the `ponko_ctx_try_load_*` functions, so the `ponko::error` they throw has the kind and path |
| `ponko_query`, `ponko_query_par` | `world_view::each` and `query` (and the `_par` versions) call `ponko_query_with`, `ponko_query_filtered` or `ponko_query_cached`, which also take change filters |
| `ponko_filter_check` | `with`, `without`, `or_` and `all_of` are C++ types; the query checks them when it runs |
| `ponko_quat_mul`, `ponko_quat_rotate` | `quat * quat` and `quat * vec3`, inline, with the same results |
| `ponko_entity_bits` | `ponko::bits(entity)`, inline |
| `ponko_text3d_default` | `ponko::text3d{}`: its member initializers are the same defaults |
| `ponko_game_plugin` | `game::plugin(object)`, for any object with `build(ponko::game&)` and an optional `setup(ponko::ctx&)` |

`scripts/check-cpp-api.py` keeps this true: CI fails when a C function has no
C++ wrapper and isn't on this list (`scripts/cpp-c-only.txt`, with the reasons).
The same check requires a `///` doc comment on every public declaration in
`ponko.hpp`, which is the C++ API reference: what each call does, its units,
who owns what, and what it throws. The C and C++ snippets in this guide come
from `examples/cpp` (`guide.cpp`, `guide.c` and the examples), which CI builds
and runs.

## Still Rust-only

C and C++ resources and components are plain structs (no `std::string`
or `std::vector` inside), copied in and out.

Most chapters show Rust and C++ side by side. These features exist only in
Rust today; the chapters say so where they use them.
`scripts/check-ffi-coverage.py` checks this table against
`scripts/rust-only.txt`, and that every name still exists in the Rust
source and has no C function of its own, so a row goes away when its C
binding arrives:

| Rust feature | Where | From C and C++ |
|---|---|---|
| `Assets::scene_asset_field` | [Asset sources](asset-sources.md) | C components have no text fields to name an asset in; load what a scene needs before `load_scene` |
| `Query::with_lookup`, `World::get_many_mut` | [Entities, components, queries](ecs.md#borrowing-several-things-at-once) | Generic borrows; component pointers from `get` don't borrow |
| `SystemView` | [Declared system access](system-access.md) | C and C++ systems take the whole `ctx`, so they run alone; declare their access by name |
| `Storage::write_json`, `Storage::read_json` | [Saves and settings](storage.md#save-slots) | Generic over Rust types; serialize yourself and pass the bytes to `storage_write` and `storage_read` |
| `UiAccessAdapter::for_ns_view` | [Retained game UI](ui.md#the-screen-reader-adapter) | It needs a Rust `Ui`; the engine's own window gets the adapter, and `ponko_ui_access_*` give a snapshot for one of your own |
| `NavObstacleShape` | [3D navigation meshes](navigation3d.md#obstacle-shapes) | Obstacles are unturned boxes: `ponko_ctx_set_nav_obstacle` and `ponko_ctx_set_nav_carve_obstacle` |

System phases, system ids, setup callbacks and plugins are not on this
list. They have C and C++ calls, described in
[Systems and the frame](systems.md):

| Rust | C++ | C |
|---|---|---|
| `Game::add(phase, f)` | `game::add(ponko::phase::..., f)` | `ponko_game_add_system` |
| `Game::add_system(phase, f)` → `SystemId` | `game::add_system` → `ponko::system_id` | `ponko_game_add_system_id` |
| `Game::remove(id)`, `Systems::DRAW_SPRITES` | `game::remove(id)`, `ponko::systems::draw_sprites` | `ponko_game_remove`, `PONKO_SYSTEM_DRAW_SPRITES` |
| `Game::setup(f)` | `game::setup(f)` | `ponko_game_setup` |
| `Plugin`, `Game::plugin` | an object with `build` (and `setup`), `game::plugin` | `ponko_game_plugin` |

The functions in `ponko::systems` themselves add a built-in back in
another place: `ponko_game_add_builtin` (`game::add_builtin` in C++) takes
the phase and the built-in's id, and gives the physics and navmesh steps
their declarations. `ponko_builtin_access` (`access::builtin`) returns a
built-in's declaration.
