# Browser smoke test

Checks that a web build actually runs in a browser, which compiling to
wasm can't: `smoke.mjs` serves a site built by `web/build.sh`, opens it in
a headless browser (Chromium, Firefox or WebKit; no window) and checks, in
order:

1. **Startup**: the game reaches its first frame (no panic, no page error).
   The engine's own GPU report (`Graphics::gpu_capabilities`) must then agree with
   the canvas: an engine that says `gl` on a canvas with a WebGPU context, or
   the reverse, fails.
2. **Assets**: `assets/index.json` and the fixture's asset were fetched
   (HTTP 200); a texture also decoded at its real size. In the 2D fixture, an
   image and streamed music from the game's in-memory asset source loaded by
   name without being fetched.
3. **Progress**: the fixed-step simulation keeps ticking (at least 60 ticks
   in 3 seconds, a third of the 60 Hz rate; a coarse bound, not a frame-rate
   assertion, kept above the `stall` self-test's 20 ticks).
4. **Input**: a click on the canvas reaches the game, then each `--press` key.
   **Music** (`--music required`, the 2D fixture): music the game started
   during setup waits for that click. Before it, the game reports
   `audio_unlocked: false` and the page has no `AudioContext` (a browser keeps
   one opened before a gesture suspended); within 10 s after it, the game
   reports `audio_unlocked: true`, an `AudioContext` is `running`, and buffers
   with sound in them have been played. The runner watches the page's
   `AudioContext` and `AudioBufferSourceNode.start` to see this.
5. **State minimums** (`--min`): fields the fixture must report at least
   (the 3D fixture's models and triangles drawn).
   **Storage** (`--after-reload`): once the game's writes are stored (its
   `saving` field is no longer `true`), the page is reloaded, and the new page
   must report the given fields (`coin_dash`: the settings it saved when the
   settings screen was left are `Loaded` from the browser's storage, which is
   `persistent`).
6. **Rendering**: the canvas is not blank (screenshot, or a copy of the
   canvas for WebGPU).

## Fixtures

A fixture is an example that publishes its state with the helper
`examples/common/web_smoke.rs`: `<html data-smoke>` every frame (ticks,
frames, clicks, size and whatever the fixture adds) and `<html data-smoke-gpu>`
once (the engine's adapter report as JSON). `fixtures.json` says what the
runner needs to know about each one, so `--fixture <name>` is all a run takes:

| Fixture | Example | Features | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web_smoke` | `examples/web_smoke.rs` | none | `crab.png` fetched and decoded 32x32; an image and streamed music loaded from an in-memory asset source; the music, started at setup, heard after the first click; sprites drawn |
| `web_smoke_3d` | `examples/web_smoke_3d.rs` | `3d` | `models/house.glb` fetched and parsed; a sun with shadows; at least 1 model and 100 triangles drawn |
| `coin_dash` | `examples/coin_dash` | none | the complete game: its picture, keys and the screens they reach (see [A complete game, packaged](../../book/src/packaging.md#the-web-build)); after a reload, the settings it saved come back from the browser's storage |
| `lights2d` | `examples/lights2d.rs` | none | `crab.png` fetched and decoded 32x32; 2D lights with stencil shadows and normal maps drawing on the page's backend (WebGL2 in CI); at least 7 lights

To add one: publish the state with the helper (or the same attributes by hand),
add an entry to `fixtures.json` (`example`, `features`, `asset`, `assetSize`
or none, `assetSource` or none, `presses`, `min`, `afterReload`, `engineGpu`,
`music`), and name it in the CI job. Every
fixture needs `?smoke_case=panic` and `?smoke_case=stall` handled if it is to
run the self-tests; the helper does that.

## The web gallery

`gallery.mjs` checks the [web gallery](../gallery/README.md) the same way,
for pages whose examples publish no state: every page must start its game,
keep drawing, survive a click and show a canvas that isn't blank, or, for a
demo that needs WebGPU on a page without it, say so instead of starting. The
gallery's README has how to run it; `gallery-lib.test.mjs` tests its
decisions.

## Running it

```sh
cd web/smoke && npm ci
# One browser's download is 100 to 200 MB; here inside this folder:
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$PWD/.browsers node node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js install --only-shell chromium
cd ../..
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$PWD/web/smoke/.browsers \
  node web/smoke/smoke.mjs --fixture web_smoke --build --backend webgl2
```

`--build` runs `web/build.sh` for the fixture (with its Cargo features) into
`target/web/<example>`; without it, build that folder yourself (for the 3D
fixture, `web/build.sh --features 3d web_smoke_3d`), or point `--dir` at any
built site. For the other browsers install `firefox` or `webkit` (and
`chromium`, not `--only-shell`, for `--chromium-mode new`), then pass
`--browser firefox`.

Without `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`, Playwright uses its usual cache folder.
Remove `web/smoke/.browsers` and `web/smoke/node_modules` when done; both are
git-ignored. The wasm build is a full extra copy of the dependencies:
`rm -rf target/wasm32-unknown-unknown target/web` afterwards.

`node --test web/smoke/*.test.mjs` runs the runner's own tests (no browser or build).

Options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--fixture <name>` | A fixture of `fixtures.json`: its example, features, asset, key presses and minimums are the defaults (`--build` builds it first). |
| `--dir <site>` | The built site, instead of `target/web/<example>`. |
| `--browser chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit` | The browser (default `chromium`). |
| `--chromium-mode shell` / `new` | Chromium's headless shell (default) or the full browser in its new headless mode, which has the compositor a WebGPU canvas is presented through. |
| `--backend webgl2` | Hide WebGPU from the page, so the engine takes its WebGL2 fallback. |
| `--backend webgpu` | Require WebGPU; "unsupported" if the browser has no adapter or can't show a WebGPU canvas. |
| `--backend auto` | Let the engine choose; the report says which it used. |
| `--case missing-asset` / `panic` / `stall` | Self-tests: answer 404 for the fixture's asset, panic during setup (`?smoke_case=panic`), or pause the simulation (`?smoke_case=stall`). The run passes only if that failure is detected. |
| `--timeout <s>` | Seconds to wait for the first frame (default 90). |
| `--run-timeout <s>` | The whole run's deadline (default 300): past it the run fails as `browser-hang`, naming the step it was on, and exits (which kills the browser). |
| `--allow-unsupported` | Exit 0 instead of 2 when the browser lacks the backend (the report and the last line still say UNSUPPORTED). |
| `--asset <file>` / `--asset-size <W>x<H>` / `none` | Without a fixture: the file under `assets/` that must be fetched (default `crab.png`), and the size it must decode to. |
| `--asset-source <W>x<H>` / `none` | The size the image from the game's in-memory asset source must decode to (the state's `source`); its streamed music must load too, and nothing under `assets/embedded/` may be fetched. Default `4x2` without a fixture. |
| `--press <Key>=<field>:<value>` | After the click, press the key (Playwright key name: `Enter`, `Escape`, `Q`) and wait up to 10 s for the reported state's `<field>` to become `<value>`. Repeatable, in order. |
| `--min <field>=<n>` | The reported state's numeric `<field>` must be at least `n`. Repeatable. |
| `--after-reload <field>:<value>` | After the presses, reload the page (once the state's `saving` is not `true`); the new page's `<field>` must then be `<value>`. Repeatable. |
| `--engine-gpu required` | Fail when the fixture publishes no engine GPU report (fixtures set this). |
| `--music required` / `none` | Check that music started at setup waits for the first click and is heard after it (the fixture reports `audio_unlocked`). `required` for fixtures with `"music": true`. |
| `--no-trace` / `--chrome-trace` | Skip the Playwright trace, or also write Chromium's GPU trace (it slows a heavy page a lot, enough to trip the stall check on a 3D scene: use it on the 2D fixture, or to look at one run). |
| `--out <dir>` | Where artifacts go (default `target/web-smoke/<fixture>-<browser>-<backend>-<case>`). |
| `--browser-arg <flag>` | Extra browser flag (repeatable). |

## Results

Exit codes: **0** passed, **1** the game failed (or an installed browser would
not start), **2** unsupported (the browser isn't installed, or lacks the
backend asked for), **3** bad arguments or no build. "Unsupported" is decided
without the engine: WebGPU counts as available only if a plain WebGPU canvas,
cleared to red by the runner itself and read back in the same task, is red.
It is never a pass without a reason: the last line, `report.json` and the CI
summary table all say `UNSUPPORTED` and why (no `navigator.gpu`, no adapter,
no canvas), even under `--allow-unsupported`.

A browser that stops answering can't hang a run: once the page is open,
every browser call (reading the state, a click, a key, a screenshot) has a
30 s deadline, a page whose content process crashes fails at once
(`browser-crash`), and the whole run has `--run-timeout`. A hang fails as
`browser-hang` with the step it was on and the last lines of `browser.log`.
A hung run is not retried: so far every hang has been a real, repeatable
failure, and a retry would hide the next one. CI also gives each browser step
a `timeout-minutes` of a few minutes.

WebKit on Linux needs a sound server and a channel count. It opens its audio
output through GStreamer and reads an AudioContext's output channels
(`destination.maxChannelCount`) from GStreamer's list of audio devices.
Without a sound server its content process crashes when a page asks, which
the engine does when it opens its audio at a game's first click (the log
shows GStreamer's PulseAudio device provider failing to connect, then
"double free or corruption"). With one, the list can still come back empty,
the count is 0, and the engine's audio output refuses to open (the report's
`audio` shows a running context with 0 output channels and 0 buffers). CI
starts PulseAudio with a null sink and sets
`WEBKIT_GST_MAX_NUMBER_OF_AUDIO_OUTPUT_CHANNELS=2` for the WebKit runs; do
the same on a headless Linux machine
(`pulseaudio --daemonize=yes --exit-idle-time=-1`, then
`pactl load-module module-null-sink`).

Each run writes to its `--out` folder:

- `report.json`: browser version, platform, launch options, the WebGPU adapter
  and WebGL2 renderer the browser offers, the backend the game's canvas used,
  **the engine's own report** (`engine.gpu`: adapter, limits and every renderer
  feature with its fallback; `engine.summary`), startup time, total elapsed
  time, the state before and after the progress check, canvas statistics, every
  request with its status, console messages, page errors and the outcome
  (`kind`: `pass`, `asset`, `panic`, `page-error`, `stall`, `startup-timeout`,
  `input`, `state`, `blank`, `backend`, `launch`, `unsupported`,
  `browser-hang`, `browser-crash`, ...) with the `step` the run was on.
- `console.log`: the page's console.
- `browser.log`: the browser's own output (its process's stdout and stderr,
  launch and exit, through Playwright's `pw:browser` channel). A browser that
  hangs or crashes often says why only here.
- `trace.zip`: Playwright's trace (actions, requests, screenshots over time);
  open it with `node node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js show-trace trace.zip`.
- `chrome-trace.json` (`--chrome-trace`, Chromium): the GPU process and
  compositor frames, for chrome://tracing or Perfetto.
- `canvas.png`: the canvas after the click; `page.png`: the page on failure.

`node web/smoke/summary.mjs target/web-smoke` prints every run's report as a
table (and appends it to a GitHub job summary).

## What runs where

| Where | Browser | WebGL2 (forced) | WebGPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI (`web-smoke` job, `main` and `full-ci`, ubuntu-latest, no GPU) | Chromium (headless shell and full browser), Firefox, WebKit from Playwright | Must pass in Chromium and WebKit, for the 2D and 3D fixtures (software GL); `coin_dash` in Chromium. Firefox is tried and reported: headless Firefox has no WebGL2 on that runner, so it reads "unsupported" | Tried; passes as "unsupported", with the reason, where the browser can't show a WebGPU canvas; where it can, the game must draw through it |
| CI, every pull request (`web-smoke-runner`) | none | the runner's own tests only (and the gallery's) | |
| Release workflow (`gallery` job, ubuntu-latest, no GPU) | Chromium headless shell | Every gallery page must pass (software GL) | Not tried; the demos that need WebGPU must show their message |
| Apple Silicon Mac, the gallery (`gallery.mjs`) | Chromium 156 | Every page passes in the headless shell; the 2 demos that need WebGPU (compute passes) show their message | Every page passes in new headless mode on the Metal adapter |
| Apple Silicon Mac, Chromium new headless mode | Chromium 156 | Passes (ANGLE on Metal) | **Passes** on the Metal adapter: the engine reports `webgpu`, the canvas draws |
| Apple Silicon Mac, Chromium headless shell | same | Passes (ANGLE on SwiftShader) | Unsupported: a SwiftShader fallback adapter exists, but a WebGPU canvas can't be shown |
| Apple Silicon Mac, WebKit (Playwright build) | WebKit 27 | Passes | Passes on its own adapter |

Not covered yet: Firefox on a Mac with its Playwright build here (it would
not start on the development machine, and on CI's Linux runner it has no
WebGL2, so Firefox has not drawn a frame anywhere yet), WebGPU on a
GPU-less Linux runner (the CI job tries it and reports), and mobile
browsers.
